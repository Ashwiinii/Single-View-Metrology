# Single-View-Metrology
## DESCRIPTION
Given a 2-D image, 3D affine measurements are computed from a single perspective view of a scene using minimal geometric information of the 2-D image, as applied by Criminisi, Reid and Zisserman in “Single View Metrology”.

The project is divided into 4 subtasks :
1) Image Acquisition
2) Computing Vanishing Points
3) Computing Projection Matrix and Homograph Matrix 
4) Visualizing the reconstructed 3D model

The transformed images were then imported into Blender, a 3D visualization software to render the model.
